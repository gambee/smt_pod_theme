# SMT-Pod Theme

### A 30s Introductory Theme Composed For SMT-Pod

A call for scores was extended by [The Society for Music Theory](https://societymusictheory.org/) for short pieces to be used as the thematic material for their podcast, [SMT-Pod](https://smt-pod.org/). This is my contribution; see player below score to listen to a digital realization. If selected, a professional recording will be commissioned, and delevered within two weeks.
